gRPC is used extensively in modern architectures and micro-services, so we added this very useful trigger type for creating tests in Tracetest.

👉 **Join our [shared Pokeshop API Demo environment](https://app.qualitytrace.io/organizations/ttorg_2179a9cd8ba8dfa5/invites/invite_760904a64b4b9dc9/accept) and try creating a Test yourself!**

Click the gRPC option to continue:

![Choose Trigger](../img/choose-trigger-0.16.png)

In this example, gRPC Request has been chosen.

![Choose Example](../img/choose-gRPC-0.16.png)

Input the **Name** and **Trigger** details or select one of the example provided in the drop down:

Add any additional information and click **Run**:

When the test is finished, you will get the following results:
